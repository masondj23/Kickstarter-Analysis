# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to vizualize campaign outcomes for a playwrite named louise. Using launch dates and funding goals we were able to tell louise what strategies would work the best to fund her play.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Lousie saw the most successful outcomes between the months of April and July. Louise saw quite a few failed outcomes in the month of October.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Lousie was typically successful in fundraising in most goal ranges but was most successful when raising above $1000 and saw a dip when raising $45000 - $49999.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I encountered challenges when using the COUNTIFS function.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theatre is successful when launched in the months of May and June. Theatre is the least successful when launched in the months of November and Decemeber.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It is best to raise over $1000 but once the $1000 threshold is met, you do not have to increase funding to be more successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Goals are placed into larger ranges and could lead to incorrect info.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a pie chart representing the most successful months to host theatre or a a stacked column representing the % successful, failed, and canceleld for each fundraising goal range.
